 * shared, and anything written to browser storage survives logout for the next
 * member of staff — or for a browser extension — to read.
 *
 * Unlike the original design, losing this on refresh is not recoverable: the
 * access token lives in memory too (`shared/api/tokenStore`) and the backend
 * returns tokens in a response body rather than an httpOnly cookie, so there
 * is nothing left to restore the session from. A reload signs the user out.

   * it on the parsed wire type would misrepresent where it came from. The
   * sign-in form records it; the lock screen needs it to re-authenticate,
   * since the login endpoint takes a username and there is no other way to
   * recover one.
   *
   * Always present whenever `session` is: the token lives in memory only, so a
   * session can only exist if this page-life performed the sign-in.
