/**
 * Role → permissions, decided on the client. **ADR-012.**
 *
 * §9.2 forbids exactly this, and the reason it gives is sound: if the server
 * owns permissions, a frontend that derives them from a role will eventually
 * disagree with the server and lie to the user about what they may do.
 *
 * That reason does not apply to this backend, because there is nothing to
 * disagree with. `/api/me/` returns a `role` string and nothing else; there is
 * no permission model, no per-view authorisation, and `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_
 * CLASSES` is `IsAuthenticated` alone. The server does not distinguish an
 * admin from a doctor at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ Which makes the honest reading of this table: **it is not security, and
 * here it is not even a reflection of security.** It arranges the interface so
 * a doctor is not shown billing controls. Anyone who wants past it needs
 * DevTools and five seconds, and the server will serve them. Closing that is a
 * backend change (see the review's §A3) and this table is not a substitute for
 * it — it is a placeholder shaped like the thing that should exist, so that
 * when `/api/me/` grows a `permissions[]` array this file is the only one that
 * has to be deleted.
