 * tenant header to send. Django re-derives the user from the token on every
 * request and is the only thing that decides what may be read or written.
 *
 * It exists because `/api/me/` returns neither the user's id nor their clinic
 * (see `UserMeSerializer`), and query keys have to be scoped by tenant (§6.2).
 * The token already carries `user_id` — simplejwt puts it there and the
 * backend's own `CustomJwtAuthentication` reads exactly that claim — so this
 * avoids asking for a serializer change to learn something we were already
 * handed.
